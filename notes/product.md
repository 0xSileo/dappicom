## Client operation

### Short term
It's unclear how many opcodes we can process at a time, but let's assume one opcode is given 21 steps. The average opcode takes ~4 cycles. That's ~5 steps / cycle. That translate to about 8.5M steps/s. If we're limited to ~128-256 steps/proof and the proof generation time is somewhere between 10-20seconds, then we are looking at days of time to prove a second.

Now, what we can do to try and speed this up is first assume there is work to be done to shave down constants (both on Noir side and on circuit FE). Let's say we get a 6x factor speedup. That's ~1000 steps/proof at 10-20s/proof. We can also parallelize this and by keeping each proof to smaller circuits, we can run them on many small machines. Assuming 80 machines @ 0.03$/hr is ~2k/mo to run the machine. 80 machines then split across opcodes and memory proving effectively means we get 2000-4000 steps/s (40k steps/10-20s). That means each 1s of gameplay takes about 30-60min to prove. 

This is a relatively conservative estimate, in my view. What this does, however, is allow us to run an experiment of an "onchain" NES game in the "twitch plays pokemon" style. Individuals can contribute 1s of gameplay using some type of "meta." We could leave this experiment running for 1 month @ 2k$. All seems perfectly feasible.

### Long term
The NES processor ran at a freq of ~1.7Mhz, if we assume average of 3 cycles/instruction and about ~75B added to the trace / instruction then we will have to deal with 37.5MB/s in I/O â€” obviously way too heavy for the client. What instead we can do is record user input in a compressed way and sync it to the clock cycles of the emulator. Then we feed that user input back to a headless emulator "re-running" the game. This means the emulator would also need to download the ROM somehow. Perhaps the user could reference a shared ROM at some location (in the example of free homebrew games).

This is all assuming we can get the proof times down. Now, I think in order to achieve this we really need to switch to a backend which can bring down constants heavily for each operation in the proof generation. That could be something Nova-based or more simply STARK based. This backend doesn't currently exist, so it would need to be implemented and that is a task in and of itself.

In addition, with the help of more eyeballs and some time testing, we may identify ways to save on constraints (also potential to leverage builtins?). 

Altogether, if we're optimistic and assume a 100x speedup, that gives us 40k steps/s. If we're really optimistic we get 400k steps/s. Also considering Risc Zero recently boasted 2Mhz speed using 100 GPUs. We can say that with enough time and patience, we can get to nearly a 1-1 playtime / proving time. 

This obviously would cost $$$ for the time on the hardware. Why would you do this? Well, I can think of speedruns or special achievements which unlock other things of value. What's $10-30 to get a rare badge or to prove you are #1 on the speedrun leaderboard?

## Code Structure

That means in addition to the prover (circuits) and the emulator (tetanes) we will also need a client/server library. I leave this here as a marker of that work to be done.
