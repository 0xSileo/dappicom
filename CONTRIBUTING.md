## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, you can message us in the #dappicom channel on the [Tonk Discords](https://discord.gg/usRBwU5rpN). Please do take a look at the [Roadmap and Product Flow Technical Document](TECHNICAL.md). 

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. 

- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [Issues](/issues).
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) using the "bug template". (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) 

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for CONTRIBUTING.md, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.


#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- At this stage of the project, idea generation is a good thing not a bad thing, so feel free to throw out whatever kind of wacky ideas you have. These will be prioritized by the maintaining team with labels, but there's no such thing as a "bad idea" even if we decide it's out of scope for the project long term.

### Core Contributions

There are several tracks of work at the moment to complete the "Foundation V0" part of the [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) roadmap. These tracks of work have been broken into milestones to aggregate related issues

They are

- [OPCODES](https://github.com/tonk-gg/dappicom/milestone/1)
- [PROOF AGGREGATION AND CONTINUATIONS](https://github.com/tonk-gg/dappicom/milestone/2)
- [ENGINE](https://github.com/tonk-gg/dappicom/milestone/3)

If you would like to contribute to any of these core pieces, please find the issue and either follow the instructions on the issue (if it's a tracker) or comment on the issue that you would like to take it on.

### Your First Code Contribution

If a Core contribution seems too daunting, then you can search the [Issues](/issues) for those labeled with "good first issue". 

## Styleguides
### Commit Messages
For PRs we use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) naming convention.

## Join The Project Team
